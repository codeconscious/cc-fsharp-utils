# CodeConscious F# Utilities

This is a tiny library intended to house my F# utility functions for use across across multiple solutions. Since its purpose is solely to be used in my personal projects and for F# and functional programming training, I do not recommend its use by anyone else. (For one, the API might change wildly without notice.)
